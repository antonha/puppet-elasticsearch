Dependencies:

You need to have https://github.com/meltwater/puppet-archive in your module path. You might want to include https://github.com/meltwater/puppet-java as well. 
The manifest was only tested on CentOS.

Usage:

In your templates.pp or nodes.pp or wherever you define your server roles and applications you can call the elasticsearch module like so:

node /mw-dev-es-\d\d\d/ {
    class { elasticsearch: 
      version => "0.15.2",
      user => "www-data",
      basepath => "/meltwater"
    }
}

elasticsearch will be downloaded as tgz from github.

The module will install a simple init.d script, code borrowed from https://github.com/camptocamp/puppet-tomcat
